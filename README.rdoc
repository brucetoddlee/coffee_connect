== CoffeeConnect

CoffeeConnect lets you find a nearby coffee shop where the Wi-Fi is good enough to get work done.

CoffeeConnect automatically determines your location and shows you a map view or list view of nearby coffee shops, their Yelp star ratings, and their Wi-Fi quality rating.

When you’re at a coffee shop and using its Wi-Fi, you can run a broadband speed test and contribute to the coffee shop’s overall Wi-Fi quality rating.
